Made of cold.
They celebrate.
We just sleep.
On holiday.
And with their doubts, they grow on me.
Been on the phone, since yesterday.

(Chorus)
And your faith reveals the world and all the things you could have seen.
Its all the same, you're all insane.
When your breeze becomes a storm, then you'll all be washed away
Its all the same, you're all insane.

And a road, stood separately.
Under fire.
But not for me.
And to this sound, come roll with me.
To our home, and make believe.

(Chorus)
And your faith reveals the world and all the things you could have seen.
Its all the same, you're all insane.
When your breeze becomes a storm, then you'll all be washed away.
Its all the same, you're all insane.

And all my wicked ways.
You're on your own again.
I'm on my own again.
And all my wicked ways.
You're on your own again.
I'm on my own again.

(Chorus)
And your faith reveals the world and all the things you could have seen.
Its all the same, you're all insane.
When your breeze becomes a storm, then you'll all be washed away.
Its all the same, you're all insane.

And all my wicked ways.
You're on your own again.
I'm on my own again.
And all my wicked ways.
You're on your own again.
I'm on my own again.
